            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Supervised Learning</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
                <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data. The model makes predictions based on the input data and adjusts itself based on the correct answers provided.</p>

            <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <p>In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it. The model tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the data.</p>

            <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <p>Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make a sequence of decisions by rewarding it for good decisions and punishing it for bad ones. This type of learning is used in robotics, game playing, and more.</p>
